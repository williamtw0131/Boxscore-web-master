This is a websire I made 4 years ago when I tried to get in to IT industry. I took a few courses including CS50, CS50P and Django on Youtube to learn how to do it.
After 4 years, I feel like my current job is not what I want to do, therefore I came back here to see if there's a chance for me.
When I first try to re launch this web, there's a little problem that Django updated their package, thus, it took me a while to read through the document to find out what should I do to make this website run again.
After fixing it, I did not modify but just upload it.

1. How to run this website locally?
If you would like to run this website locally, please first make sure the env for Python and Django are both ready. Then, you can download the whole file.
After that, you can go to your terminal and change the directory to the place you saved this file.
Lastly, type in "python manage.py runserver", then you can see my masterpiese at the following URL: http://127.0.0.1:8000

2. How does this website work?
First of all, you will need to register a user to key in your game data. So simply follow the instruction on my website to sign up and after succeed, you will be automatically logged in.

When logged in, you will see a few option(link) you can click on, such as sign up a team, update games, add stat for a game, search for statics, and edit statics.

Sign up a team: you can sign up as many team as you want. Let's say you're a coach, you may lead more than 1 team. My site can let you sign all your teams up and keep record.

Update games: in each team, let's say in 1 season, your team may play 20 games with different opponents, you can record each of the game you play. After updating a game, the web will automatically redirect you to add statistics of your team players.

Add stat for a game: you can add statistcis of your players in each team and each game.(make sure you key in the data. correctly, since my website will calculate the ave. for you)

After all the aboves are done, you can review the stat. again and see if any is wrong. If yes, you can click on the edit statics to revise.

Search for statics: This is the place that you can search the statics by team name or by player's number.

Please feel free to poke around and let me know if you have any suggestion on my website to help me make it better.
